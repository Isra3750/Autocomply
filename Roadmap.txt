From today until september 2025 - just before i start my masters. what should i focus on. I don't wanna spread myself too thin, I'm not great as DSA but I'm not sure how useful it would be to grind leetcode if I wanna go to do reserach in the fields I mention.

Since you have until September 2025 before starting your Master’s in ECE at Northeastern, here’s a focused roadmap based on your goals:


📌 PRIMARY FOCUS: Build Research Readiness
Since you want to do research in ML/AI, Robotics, Databases, or Software, grinding LeetCode isn’t necessary unless you're targeting software engineering jobs at FAANG-level companies. Instead, focus on:

Strengthening your theoretical and practical knowledge in one or two research areas.
Gaining hands-on experience through research projects.
Networking & publishing to increase your chances of an RA position.
🛠️ ROADMAP (Feb 2025 – Sept 2025)
📚 1. Choose & Specialize in 1-2 Research Areas
Avoid spreading yourself too thin! Pick at most two from:

Machine Learning / AI
Robotics & Control Systems
Databases & Cloud Systems
Software Engineering Research
🔹 Suggested Choices Based on Your Skills:

ML/AI + Databases (if you like coding and data-driven work)
Robotics + AI (if you enjoy hands-on work with hardware)
👉 Decide within 1-2 weeks so you can focus deeply.


💻 2. Strengthen Research-Oriented Skills
Instead of LeetCode, focus on applied skills relevant to research:

Machine Learning / AI Path
✅ Mathematics for ML (Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimization) ✅ Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow ✅ Work on Research-Level ML Problems

Reimplement recent ML papers from NeurIPS, CVPR, ICML.
Kaggle is fine, but research-level benchmark datasets (ImageNet, OpenAI datasets) are better.
Robotics & AI Path
✅ ROS (Robot Operating System) – Essential for research. ✅ Gazebo / MuJoCo for Simulations. ✅ Reinforcement Learning for Robotics (OpenAI Gym, RL algorithms). ✅ Work on a ROS-based robot project (e.g., TurtleBot, Jetson Nano).

Databases & Systems Path
✅ Advanced SQL & Query Optimization ✅ Distributed Databases (Google Spanner, CockroachDB) ✅ Benchmark & Improve Database Performance ✅ Build a mini-distributed database system (if serious about DB research).


📄 3. Build Research Experience (Mini-Projects & Paper Reading)
Instead of more coursework, work on mini-research projects.

Read 1 research paper per week (from NeurIPS, CVPR, SIGMOD, ICRA).
Reproduce ML models or database experiments.
Write a short blog post or summary about your implementation.
Where to Find Papers?
Google Scholar (Top venues for ML, AI, DB, Robotics)
PapersWithCode (Find ML papers with open-source implementations)
ArXiv (Preprints of research work)
Start an Independent Research Project
Aim for a research-style project that could lead to a paper submission.
Example: "Optimizing Query Execution on Edge Databases" (for DB).
Example: "Improving Sample Efficiency in RL for Robotics" (for AI+Robotics).


🤝 4. Networking & RA Position Hunting
To increase your RA chances at Northeastern: ✅ Cold email professors in your target areas. ✅ Attend research webinars / conferences (NeurIPS, ICRA, SIGMOD). ✅ Write a research blog on Medium/GitHub showcasing what you learn.

🔹 How to Reach Professors?

Identify Northeastern ML, AI, Robotics, or DB professors.
Email them with:
Your background + why you're interested in their work.
Any relevant projects you’ve done.
Offer to help in their ongoing research.
💼 5. Internships & Co-op Prep
Apply for research internships at universities or AI labs.
Look for AI, Robotics, or Database engineering co-ops.
Work on a strong GitHub portfolio (implementing research papers).
🔹 Should You Do LeetCode? Only if you want a Software Engineering job. Otherwise, focus on:

System Design (for Databases, Distributed Computing).
Algorithm Implementation (for ML/AI research).
📆 Suggested Timeline
Month	Focus Area	Task
Feb 2025	Choose Specialization	Pick ML/AI, Robotics, or Databases
Mar - Apr 2025	Skill Development	Learn ML, Robotics, or DB tools (PyTorch, ROS, etc.)
May - June 2025	Mini-Research Projects	Implement & Reproduce ML/AI or DB experiments
July - Aug 2025	Paper Writing & Networking	Write a research blog, Email professors for RA
Sept 2025	Apply for RA & Co-op	Submit research proposals, finalize projects
🎯 Final Thoughts – What NOT to Do
❌ Don’t spread across too many fields – Pick at most 2. ❌ Don’t blindly grind LeetCode – Do it only if you want software jobs. ❌ Don’t just do tutorials – Focus on actual research work.
